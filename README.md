This project is a Business Intelligence solution developed for the Ombudsman Office of Limeira City Hall. The objective is to transform unstructured public data into a clear, modern, and intuitive BI experience that 
supports transparency and data-driven decision-making.
The dataset was originally available only in PDF format. Data extraction was performed using Python, with the Camelot library responsible for extracting tabular data from the PDF files and Pandas used for data cleaning, 
normalization, and structuring. After the transformation process, the data was uploaded to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for structured storage and querying.
The processed data was then consumed in Power BI, where a modern and visually refined report was developed. The dashboard was designed to provide intuitive navigation and powerful insights, enabling efficient analysis of 
ombudsman-related data and supporting strategic evaluation of public service performance.
